## üíæ Data Persistence & Backups

**IMPORTANT**: Your data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- ‚úÖ Data persists between browser sessions
- ‚úÖ Works completely offline
- ‚úÖ No external servers required
- ‚úÖ Complete privacy - data never leaves your device

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Regular Backups Are Essential

Browser data can be lost if you clear cache, reinstall your OS, or switch browsers.

**Solution**: Use the built-in backup feature!

1. Click **"Data Backup"** button in the top-right corner of the app
2. Click **"Export All Data"** to download a JSON file
3. Store backups in multiple locations:
   - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)

   - Email to yourself

**Recommendation**: Export your data weekly!

### Restoring Data

1. Click **"Data Backup"** in the app
2. Click **"Import Data"**
