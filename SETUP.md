## 💾 Data Persistence & Backup

### How Data is Stored
Your data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- ✅ Data persists between sessions
- ✅ Works completely offline
- ✅ No server or internet connection needed
- ✅ Fast and instant access

### Important: Regular Backups
**CRITICAL**: Always maintain regular backups of your data!

1. **Use the Built-in Backup Feature**
   - Click "Data Backup" button in the top right
   - Export your data weekly (recommended)
   - Store backups in multiple locations:
     - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
     - External hard drive
     - Email to yourself

2. **Automatic Backup Reminder**
   - The app tracks your last backup date
   - Export creates a JSON file with all your data
   - File name includes the date for easy organization

### When Data Could Be Lost
⚠️ **Warning**: localStorage data can be lost if:
- Browser cache is cleared
- Browser data is deleted
- Operating system is reinstalled
- Different browser is used
- Incognito/Private mode is used
- Browser profile is deleted

**Solution**: Regular backups prevent data loss!

### Restoring Data
1. Click "Data Backup" button
2. Click "Import Data"
3. Select your backup JSON file
4. Confirm the import
5. Page will refresh with restored data

## 🚀 Long-Term Stability (5+ Years)

### Technology Stack Stability

### Maintenance Checklist

#### Annual Maintenance (Once a Year)
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm update

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix any vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Test the app thoroughly after updates
npm run build
```

#### Dependency Updates
The app uses locked dependency versions to prevent breaking changes. When updating:

1. **Read changelogs** before major version updates
2. **Test thoroughly** after any update
3. **Keep a backup** before updating
4. **Update one package at a time** for easier debugging

#### Breaking Change Protection
- All dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- Major updates require manual intervention
- No automatic breaking changes

### Browser Compatibility
Tested and works on:
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Opera 76+

Should continue working for 5+ years with these browsers.

### Future-Proofing Considerations

1. **localStorage Limits**
   - Current limit: ~5-10MB per domain
   - This app uses ~1-5KB per day of tasks
   - Capacity: **10,000+ days** of data (27+ years)

2. **Browser Updates**
   - Core web APIs (localStorage, DOM) are stable
   - No deprecated features used
   - Standards-compliant code

3. **If Issues Arise**
   - Export your data first
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Update dependencies
   - Restore data after fixes

## 🔒 Data Security & Privacy

- ✅ All data stays on your device
- ✅ No external servers
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ No third-party services
- ✅ Complete privacy

## 📊 Capacity & Performance

### Storage Capacity
- Average task: ~200 bytes
- Daily tasks (5 tasks): ~1KB
- 365 days: ~365KB
- 5 years: ~1.8MB
- Well under localStorage limits

### Performance
- Instant load times (local storage)
- No network latency
- Works offline
- Minimal resource usage

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### App Not Loading
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
4. Try different browser

### Data Not Persisting
1. Check if in Incognito/Private mode
2. Verify localStorage is enabled
3. Check browser storage settings
4. Export and import data

### After Browser/OS Update
1. Open the app to verify it works
2. If issues occur, export data immediately
3. Clear cache and reload
4. Import data if needed

## 🔄 Migration to Cloud (Optional)

If you eventually want cloud storage:
1. The app can be extended with Lovable Cloud
2. Your local data can be migrated
3. Contact support for migration assistance

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Weekly Backups**: Export data every Sunday
2. **Multiple Copies**: Store in 3 different locations
3. **Version Naming**: Keep dated backup files
4. **Test Restores**: Occasionally test importing backups
5. **Update Annually**: Check for dependency updates once a year
6. **Browser Updates**: Keep browser updated for security

## 📞 Support
